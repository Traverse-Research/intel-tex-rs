Rust bindings for Intel's ISPC texture compressor.

* https://github.com/GameTechDev/ISPCTextureCompressor

State of the art texture compression for BC6H, BC7, ETC1, ASTC and BC1/BC3.

ISPC and `libclang` are not required, unless regenerating the ISPC kernels:

```cargo build --features=ispc```

* ISPC compiler:
  * https://ispc.github.io/
* Also need `libclang` installed (for rust-bindgen)
  * https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html

For convenience, ISPC binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are in the repository (but not the crate).

Additionally, libclang exists in the LLVM installer for Windows, also included.

## Supported compression formats:

* BC1, BC3 (aka DXT1, DXT5) and BC4, BC5 (aka ATI1N, ATI2N)
* BC6H (FP16 HDR input)
* BC7
* ETC1

## Pending compression formats:

* ASTC (LDR, block sizes up to 8x8)
  * Work in progress

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
intel_tex = "0.1.4"
```

and add this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate intel_tex;
```

## Example

```shell
$ cargo run --release --example main

Width is 4096
Height is 4096
ColorType is RGB(8)
Converting RGB -> RGBA
Block count: 1048576
Compressing to BC7...
  Done!
